This is a personal portfolio project developed with **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The site was created as part of an academic assignment for the Software Engineering course at **[Centro Universitário Internacional Uninter](https://www.uninter.com/)** and serves as a showcase for my skills, education, and projects.

## 🚀 Project Overview

[![Project Demonstration](images/project-demo.gif)](https://emellybmuniz.github.io/coursePortfolio/)

The project is a *Single Page Application* (SPA) that clearly and modernly showcases my journey as a developer. The navigation is smooth and intuitive, with well-defined sections.

**Important:** Please note that the live website is in **Portuguese**. The section titles in this README are translated for clarity, but on the site, you will find them as "Sobre Mim", "Formação", "Portfólio", and "Contato".

## ✨ Highlights & Features
- **🎨 Responsive and Adaptive Design:** The interface adjusts perfectly to different screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **🌗 Light & Dark Theme:** A toggle in the header allows the user to choose their preferred visual theme, and the choice is saved locally.
- **🧭 Smart Navigation:**
  - **Desktop:** An elegant side menu that expands on hover, optimizing screen space.
  - **Mobile:** A fixed menu at the bottom of the screen, inspired by native apps, for easy thumb access.
- **🎬 Scroll Animations:** Sections and elements appear with subtle animations as the user scrolls, creating a more dynamic and engaging browsing experience.
- **🎠 Project Carousel:** The portfolio section features an interactive carousel on desktops and a scrollable list on mobile devices.
- **♿ Accessibility:** Accessibility best practices have been implemented, such as using `aria-label` attributes for buttons, `alt` for images, and a semantic HTML structure.

## 📝 Note on the Contact Form

The contact form on the page is purely for visual purposes and **does not have a functional backend to send emails**. This was a project decision aligned with the academic requirements of the university, which focused on developing **frontend skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)**. Upon submitting the form, the user is redirected to a static thank-you page.

To get in touch, please use the LinkedIn or email links available in the "Author" section at the end of this README.
